# Go_Your_Own_Way_travel_agency_analysis_Python

Acting as an analyst for Go Your Own Way, I was tasked with uncovering customer groupings for which specialised holiday packages could be created and revenue maximised. I performed initial and exploratory analysis on the [Travelpac](https://cy.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/leisureandtourism/datasets/travelpac) dataset from ONS in order to gain more insight into UK travel habits. I then added a geographic element using the [world countries](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ktochylin/world-countries) shapefile to the analysis before I undertook linear regression and cluster analysis to discover traveller clusters that could be used to create specific customer groups. In addition, I undertook a separate time series analysis using data from [Zillow](https://data.nasdaq.com/databases/ZILLOW).

### Who are Go Your Own Way?

Go Your Own Way is ficticious new UK travel agency looking to break into a crowded market with a more bespoke offering than rivals.

### Context

Go Your Own Way owners wanted to know the best way to go about offering specialised holiday packages by asking us to look into the ways in which customers can be grouped for ease of targeting.

### Key questions

* Where is the most popular destination for UK travellers?

* Which destination outside of Europe is most visited by UK residents?

* What is the relationship between a country's distance from the UK and the number of visits made to that country?

### Tools

I used Python and relevant libraries (pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Folium, Pylab and SKlearn) for this analysis.
